\noindent Life puts atoms together in very interesting ways. One configuration
of atoms gives us an ant carrying a leaf many times larger than itself. From
another configuration we get an eagle slipping gracefully through the sky. Yet
another configuration becomes a person who feels, thinks, and loves.

Without Life, the energy from our sun simply bounces off the planet. Life
literally collects the energy Sol sends to earth, and stores it up for future
use. Plants take energy from Sol and convert it into denser, more storable
forms. The sugars and fats that our bodies burn are little pools of energy that
originally came from our sun.

Ants carrying, eagles soaring, people loving \ldots none of these would exist
without Life's awesome capacity for organizing matter.

Life is not perfect. This is obvious to anyone who has experienced cruelty or
misfortune. And yet, Life is the only game in town. Without Life the Earth
would be just another dead ball of rock.

Nothing needs to change for Life to become ``worthy''. It already is worthy.
Even if we had more wars, more hunger, and more systemic injustice, Life would
still still be precious. Always and forever, Life is what it is \ldots and it
is worthy of veneration!

  Life creates the conditions for more Life,\\

\noindent Every one of us knows from personal experience that it is easier to
destroy things than it is to create them. In fact, we don't even need to exert
ourselves to destroy things. If we just ignore them for a while they will erode
and disappear. The destruction of possibility is the natural order of things.
Scientists call this tendency for things to run down the ``second law of
thermodynamics.'' The second law can be summarized as ``energy always flows
downhill toward less and less usable forms.''

And yet many wondrously complex things do exist! In our world that is strongly
biased towards decay and collapse, how is this possible?

Life is the force that creates an upward eddy in the downward current of
destruction. Creation by life is a process of slow growth. The laying down of
one layer on top of another. This slow process of creation often spans
generations.

Turning to Paul Krafel's ``The Upward Spiral'', we find succession as more than
just a brutal competition in which taller plants shade out shorter plants. In
fact, the shorter plants that came first created the conditions that allowed
the taller plants to exist at all. The story is about competition, but it is
not just about competition. It is also a story of multi-generational,
multi-species cooperation to slowly raise up greater and greater possibilities.

The process of evolution that created the wonderful diversity of species is a
long slow steady climb. And like the story of succession, it is a story of
competition AND a story of cooperation. The long slow steady climb of evolution
is the story of the creation of possibilities by countless individuals making
countless contributions across countless generations.

Ants carrying, eagles soaring, people loving \ldots none of these would exist
without Life's slow and steady creation. Life creates an upward spiral of
ever-growing possibilities!
